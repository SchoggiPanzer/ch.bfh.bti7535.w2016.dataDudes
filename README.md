# Sentimental Analysis of Movie Ratings
Goal of this project is it to analyse a pre-classified data set of movie reviews. To do this we implemented first the
baseline algorithm and then second the naivebayes algorithm. The features of the naivebayes are our ideas. The data set 
contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. We train the algorithm with ... reviews and test it with ... examples.

In the result we can see the accuracy, precision, recall and the f-measure.
## Installation
For the installation clone the repo like usually.
## Usage
For running the algorithm you have two options.

1.) change which algorithm (baseline or naivebayes) manually in the main function in the else statement and then run the
 Evaluate.java.
 
2.) you can write the algorithm in the input arguments when you run the algorithm by console. The arguments are 
"linebase" and "naivebayes".
