inform about project gutenberg (on page)

we produc about two million dollar for each hour we work.  the
time it take us, a rather conserv estim, is fifti hour
to get ani etext select, enter, proofread, edit, copyright
search and analyz, the copyright letter written, etc.  thi
project audienc is on hundr million reader.  if our valu
per text is nomin estim at on dollar then we produc $2
million dollar per hour thi year as we releas thirti-six text
file per month, or 432 more etext in 1999 for a total of 2000+
if these reach just 10% of the computer popul, then the
total should reach over 200 billion etext given awai thi year.

the goal of project gutenberg is to give awai on trillion etext
file by decemb 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 trillion]
thi is ten thousand titl each to on hundr million reader,
which is onli ~5% of the present number of comput user.

at our revis rate of product, we will reach onli on-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 etext unless we
manag to get some real fund; current our fund is mostli
from michael hart's salari at carnegi-mellon univers, and an
assort of sporad gift; thi salari is onli good for a few
more year, so we ar look for someth to replac it, as we
don't want project gutenberg to be so depend on on person.

we need your donat more than ever!


all donat should be made to "project gutenberg/cmu": and ar
tax deduct to the extent allow by law.  (cmu = carnegi-
mellon univers).

ber.

fran.
nai, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

ber.
long live the king!

fran.

ber.
he.

fran.
you come most carefulli upon your hour.

ber.
'ti now struck twelv. get thee to bed, francisco.

fran.
for thi relief much thank: 'ti bitter cold,
and i am sick at heart.

ber.
have you had quiet guard?

fran.
not a mous stir.

ber.
well, good night.
if you do meet horatio and marcellu,
the rival of my watch, bid them make hast.

fran.
i think i hear them.--stand, ho! who is there?

[enter horatio and marcellu.]

hor.
friend to thi ground.

mar.
and liegemen to the dane.

fran.
give you good-night.

mar.
o, farewel, honest soldier;
who hath reliev'd you?

fran.
bernardo ha my place.
give you good-night.

[exit.]

mar.
holla! bernardo!

ber.
sai.
what, is horatio there?

hor.
a piec of him.

ber.
welcom, horatio:--welcom, good marcellu.

mar.
what, ha thi thing appear'd again to-night?

ber.
i have seen noth.

mar.
horatio sai 'ti but our fantasi,
and will not let belief take hold of him
touch thi dread sight, twice seen of us:
therefor i have entreat him along
with us to watch the minut of thi night;
that, if again thi apparit come
he mai approv our ey and speak to it.

hor.
tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

ber.
sit down awhil,
and let us onc again assail your ear,
that ar so fortifi against our stori,
what we two night have seen.

hor.
well, sit we down,
and let us hear bernardo speak of thi.

ber.
last night of all,
when yond same star that's westward from the pole
had made hi cours to illum that part of heaven
where now it burn, marcellu and myself,
the bell then beat on,--

mar.
peac, break thee off; look where it come again!

[enter ghost, arm.]

ber.
in the same figur, like the king that's dead.

mar.
thou art a scholar; speak to it, horatio.

ber.
look it not like the king? mark it, horatio.

hor.
most like:--it harrow me with fear and wonder.

ber.
it would be spoke to.

mar.
question it, horatio.

hor.
what art thou, that usurp'st thi time of night,
togeth with that fair and warlik form
in which the majesti of buri denmark
did sometim march? by heaven i charg thee, speak!

mar.
it is offend.

ber.
see, it stalk awai!

hor.
stai! speak, speak! i charg thee speak!

[exit ghost.]

mar.
'ti gone, and will not answer.

ber.
how now, horatio! you trembl and look pale:
is not thi someth more than fantasi?
what think you on't?

hor.
befor my god, i might not thi believ
without the sensibl and true avouch
of mine own ey.

mar.
is it not like the king?

hor.
as thou art to thyself:
such wa the veri armour he had on
when he the ambiti norwai combat;
so frown'd he onc when, in an angri parl,
he smote the sled polack on the ic.
'ti strang.

mar.
thu twice befor, and jump at thi dead hour,
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

hor.
in what particular thought to work i know not;
but, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
thi bode some strang erupt to our state.

mar.
good now, sit down, and tell me, he that know,
why thi same strict and most observ watch
so nightli toil the subject of the land;
and why such daili cast of brazen cannon,
and foreign mart for implement of war;
why such impress of shipwright, whose sore task
doe not divid the sundai from the week;
what might be toward, that thi sweati hast
doth make the night joint-labour with the dai:
who is't that can inform me?

hor.
that can i;
at least, the whisper goe so. our last king,
whose imag even but now appear'd to us,
wa, as you know, by fortinbra of norwai,
thereto prick'd on by a most emul pride,
dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant hamlet,--
for so thi side of our known world esteem'd him,--
did slai thi fortinbra; who, by a seal'd compact,
well ratifi by law and heraldri,
did forfeit, with hi life, all those hi land,
which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
against the which, a moieti compet
wa gage by our king; which had return'd
to the inherit of fortinbra,
had he been vanquish; as by the same cov'nant,
and carriag of the articl design'd,
hi fell to hamlet. now, sir, young fortinbra,
of unimprov mettl hot and full,
hath in the skirt of norwai, here and there,
shark'd up a list of lawless resolut,
for food and diet, to some enterpris
that hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
as it doth well appear unto our state,--
but to recov of us, by strong hand,
and term compulsatori, those foresaid land
so by hi father lost: and thi, i take it,
is the main motiv of our prepar,
the sourc of thi our watch, and the chief head
of thi post-hast and romag in the land.

ber.
i think it be no other but e'en so:
well mai it sort, that thi portent figur
come arm through our watch; so like the king
that wa and is the question of these war.

hor.
a mote it is to troubl the mind's ey.
in the most high and palmi state of rome,
a littl er the mightiest juliu fell,
the grave stood tenantless, and the sheet dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman street;
as, star with train of fire and dew of blood,
disast in the sun; and the moist star,
upon whose influenc neptun's empir stand,
wa sick almost to doomsdai with eclips:
and even the like precurs of fierc event,--
as harbing preced still the fate,
and prologu to the omen come on,--
have heaven and earth togeth demonstr
unto our climatur and countrymen.--
but, soft, behold! lo, where it come again!

[re-enter ghost.]

i'll cross it, though it blast me.--stai, illus!
if thou hast ani sound, or us of voic,
speak to me:
if there be ani good thing to be done,
that mai to thee do eas, and, race to me,
speak to me:
if thou art privi to thy countri's fate,
which, happili, foreknow mai avoid,
o, speak!
or if thou hast uphoard in thy life
extort treasur in the womb of earth,
for which, thei sai, you spirit oft walk in death,
[the cock crow.]
speak of it:--stai, and speak!--stop it, marcellu!

mar.
shall i strike at it with my partisan?

hor.
do, if it will not stand.

ber.
'ti here!

hor.
'ti here!

mar.
'ti gone!

[exit ghost.]

we do it wrong, be so majest,
to offer it the show of violenc;
for it is, as the air, invulner,
and our vain blow malici mockeri.

ber.
it wa about to speak, when the cock crew.

hor.
and then it start, like a guilti thing
upon a fear summon. i have heard
the cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
doth with hi lofti and shrill-sound throat
awak the god of dai; and at hi warn,
whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
the extravag and er spirit hi
to hi confin: and of the truth herein
thi present object made probat.

mar.
it fade on the crow of the cock.
some sai that ever 'gainst that season come
wherein our saviour's birth is celebr,
the bird of dawn singeth all night long;
and then, thei sai, no spirit dare stir abroad;
the night ar wholesom; then no planet strike,
no fairi take, nor witch hath power to charm;
so hallow'd and so graciou is the time.

hor.
so have i heard, and do in part believ it.
but, look, the morn, in russet mantl clad,
walk o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
break we our watch up: and by my advic,
let us impart what we have seen to-night
unto young hamlet; for, upon my life,
thi spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
as need in our love, fit our duti?

mar.
let's do't, i prai; and i thi morn know
where we shall find him most conveni.

[exeunt.]



scene ii. elsinor. a room of state in the castl.

[enter the king, queen, hamlet, poloniu, laert, voltimand,
corneliu, lord, and attend.]

king.
though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
the memori be green, and that it us befit
to bear our heart in grief, and our whole kingdom
to be contract in on brow of woe;
yet so far hath discret fought with natur
that we with wisest sorrow think on him,
togeth with remembr of ourselv.
therefor our sometim sister, now our queen,
th' imperi jointress to thi warlik state,
have we, as 'twere with a defeat joi,--
with an auspici and on drop ey,
with mirth in funer, and with dirg in marriag,
in equal scale weigh delight and dole,--
taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
your better wisdom, which have freeli gone
with thi affair along:--or all, our thank.
now follow, that you know, young fortinbra,
hold a weak suppos of our worth,
or think by our late dear brother's death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
colleagu with thi dream of hi advantag,
he hath not fail'd to pester us with messag,
import the surrend of those land
lost by hi father, with all bond of law,
to our most valiant brother. so much for him,--
now for ourself and for thi time of meet:
thu much the busi is:--we have here writ
to norwai, uncl of young fortinbra,--
who, impot and bed-rid, scarc hear
of thi hi nephew's purpos,--to suppress
hi further gait herein; in that the levi,
the list, and full proport ar all made
out of hi subject:--and we here dispatch
you, good corneliu, and you, voltimand,
for bearer of thi greet to old norwai;
give to you no further person power
to busi with the king, more than the scope
of these dilat articl allow.
farewel; and let your hast commend your duti.

cor. and volt.
in that and all thing will we show our duti.

king.
we doubt it noth: heartili farewel.

[exeunt voltimand and corneliu.]

and now, laert, what's the new with you?
you told us of some suit; what is't, laert?
you cannot speak of reason to the dane,
and lose your voic: what wouldst thou beg, laert,
that shall not be my offer, not thy ask?
the head is not more nativ to the heart,
the hand more instrument to the mouth,
than is the throne of denmark to thy father.
what wouldst thou have, laert?

laer.
dread my lord,
your leav and favour to return to franc;
from whenc though willingli i came to denmark,
to show my duti in your coron;
yet now, i must confess, that duti done,
my thought and wish bend again toward franc,
and bow them to your graciou leav and pardon.

king.
have you your father's leav? what sai poloniu?

pol.
he hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leav
by laboursom petit; and at last
upon hi will i seal'd my hard consent:
i do beseech you, give him leav to go.

king.
take thy fair hour, laert; time be thine,
and thy best grace spend it at thy will!--
but now, my cousin hamlet, and my son--

ham.
[asid.] a littl more than kin, and less than kind!

king.
how is it that the cloud still hang on you?

ham.
not so, my lord; i am too much i' the sun.

queen.
good hamlet, cast thy night colour off,
and let thine ey look like a friend on denmark.
do not for ever with thy vail lid
seek for thy nobl father in the dust:
thou know'st 'ti common,--all that live must die,
pass through natur to etern.

ham.
ay, madam, it is common.

queen.
if it be,
why seem it so particular with thee?

ham.
seem, madam! nai, it is; i know not seem.
'ti not alon my inki cloak, good mother,
nor customari suit of solemn black,
nor windi suspir of forc'd breath,
no, nor the fruit river in the ey,
nor the deject 'havior of the visag,
togeth with all form, mood, show of grief,
that can denot me truli: these, inde, seem;
for thei ar action that a man might plai;
but i have that within which passeth show;
these but the trap and the suit of woe.

king.
'ti sweet and commend in your natur, hamlet,
to give these mourn duti to your father;
but, you must know, your father lost a father;
that father lost, lost hi; and the survivor bound,
in filial oblig, for some term
to do obsequi sorrow: but to persever
in obstin condol is a cours
of impiou stubborn; 'ti unmanli grief;
it show a will most incorrect to heaven;
a heart unfortifi, a mind impati;
an understand simpl and unschool'd;
for what we know must be, and is as common
as ani the most vulgar thing to sens,
why should we, in our peevish opposit,
take it to heart? fie! 'ti a fault to heaven,
a fault against the dead, a fault to natur,
to reason most absurd; whose common theme
is death of father, and who still hath cri,
from the first cors till he that di to-dai,
'thi must be so.' we prai you, throw to earth
thi unprevail woe; and think of us
as of a father: for let the world take note
you ar the most immedi to our throne;
and with no less nobil of love
than that which dearest father bear hi son
do i impart toward you. for your intent
in go back to school in wittenberg,
it is most retrograd to our desir:
and we beseech you bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our ey,
our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

queen.
let not thy mother lose her prayer, hamlet:
i prai thee stai with us; go not to wittenberg.

ham.
i shall in all my best obei you, madam.

king.
why, 'ti a love and a fair repli:
be as ourself in denmark.--madam, come;
thi gentl and unforc'd accord of hamlet
sit smile to my heart: in grace whereof,
no jocund health that denmark drink to-dai
but the great cannon to the cloud shall tell;
and the king's rous the heaven shall bruit again,
re-speak earthli thunder. come awai.

[exeunt all but hamlet.]

ham.
o that thi too too solid flesh would melt,
thaw, and resolv itself into a dew!
or that the everlast had not fix'd
hi canon 'gainst self-slaughter! o god! o god!
how weari, stale, flat, and unprofit
seem to me all the us of thi world!
fie on't! o fie! 'ti an unweed garden,
that grow to seed; thing rank and gross in natur
possess it mere. that it should come to thi!
but two month dead!--nai, not so much, not two:
so excel a king; that wa, to thi,
hyperion to a satyr; so love to my mother,
that he might not beteem the wind of heaven
visit her face too roughli. heaven and earth!
must i rememb? why, she would hang on him
as if increas of appetit had grown
by what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--
let me not think on't,--frailti, thy name is woman!--
a littl month; or er those shoe were old
with which she follow my poor father's bodi
like niob, all tear;--why she, even she,--
o god! a beast that want discours of reason,
would have mourn'd longer,--marri with mine uncl,
my father's brother; but no more like my father
than i to hercul: within a month;
er yet the salt of most unright tear
had left the flush in her gall ey,
she marri:-- o, most wick speed, to post
with such dexter to incestu sheet!
it is not, nor it cannot come to good;
but break my heart,--for i must hold my tongu!

[enter horatio, marcellu, and bernardo.]

against yourself: i know you ar no truant.
but what is your affair in elsinor?
we'll teach you to drink deep er you depart.

hor.

ham.

ham.
for god's love let me hear.

hor.
two night togeth had these gentlemen,
marcellu and bernardo, on their watch
in the dead vast and middl of the night,
been thu encount'd. a figur like your father,
arm at point exactli, cap-a-pe,
appear befor them and with solemn march
goe slow and state by them: thrice he walk'd
by their oppress'd and fear-surpris ey,
within hi truncheon's length; whilst thei, distil'd
almost to jelli with the act of fear,
stand dumb, and speak not to him. thi to me
in dread secreci impart thei did;
and i with them the third night kept the watch:
where, as thei had deliv'd, both in time,
form of the thing, each word made true and good,
the apparit come: i knew your father;
these hand ar not more like.

ham.
but where wa thi?

mar.
my lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

ham.
did you not speak to it?

hor.
my lord, i did;
but answer made it none: yet onc methought
it lift up it head, and did address
itself to motion, like as it would speak:
but even then the morn cock crew loud,
and at the sound it shrunk in hast awai,
and vanish'd from our sight.

ham.
'ti veri strang.

hor.
as i do live, my honour'd lord, 'ti true;
and we did think it writ down in our duti
to let you know of it.

ham.

ham.

hor.
o, ye, my lord: he wore hi beaver up.

ham.

hor.

ham.
i would i had been there.

hor.
it would have much amaz'd you.

ham.

hor.
while on with moder hast might tell a hundr.

mar. and ber.

hor.

ham.
hi beard wa grizzl,--no?

hor.

a sabl silver'd.

ham.
i will watch to-night;
perchanc 'twill walk again.

hor.
i warr'nt it will.

ham.
if it assum my nobl father's person,
i'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
and bid me hold my peac. i prai you all,
if you have hitherto conceal'd thi sight,
let it be tenabl in your silenc still;
and whatsoev els shall hap to-night,

[exeunt horatio, marcellu, and bernardo.]

my father's spirit in arm! all is not well;
i doubt some foul plai: would the night were come!
till then sit still, my soul: foul deed will rise,
though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's ey.

scene iii. a room in poloniu's hous.

[enter laert and ophelia.]

laer.
my necessari ar embark'd: farewel:
and, sister, as the wind give benefit
and convoi is assist, do not sleep,
but let me hear from you.

oph.
do you doubt that?

laer.
for hamlet, and the trifl of hi favour,
hold it a fashion, and a toi in blood:
a violet in the youth of primi natur,
forward, not perman, sweet, not last;
the perfum and supplianc of a minut;
no more.

oph.
no more but so?

laer.
think it no more:
for natur, crescent, doe not grow alon
in thew and bulk; but as thi templ wax,
the inward servic of the mind and soul
grow wide withal. perhap he love you now;
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtu of hi will: but you must fear,
hi great weigh'd, hi will is not hi own;
for he himself is subject to hi birth:
he mai not, as unvalu'd person do,
carv for himself; for on hi choic depend
the safeti and health of thi whole state;
and therefor must hi choic be circumscrib'd
unto the voic and yield of that bodi
whereof he is the head. then if he sai he love you,
it fit your wisdom so far to believ it
as he in hi particular act and place
mai give hi sai deed; which is no further
than the main voic of denmark goe withal.
then weigh what loss your honour mai sustain
if with too credent ear you list hi song,
or lose your heart, or your chast treasur open
to hi unmast'd importun.
fear it, ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
and keep you in the rear of your affect,
out of the shot and danger of desir.
the chariest maid is prodig enough
if she unmask her beauti to the moon:
virtu itself scope not calumni stroke:
the canker gall the infant of the spring
too oft befor their button be disclo'd:
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagi blastment ar most immin.
be wari then; best safeti li in fear:
youth to itself rebel, though none els near.

oph.
i shall th' effect of thi good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart. but, good my brother,
do not, as some ungraci pastor do,
show me the steep and thorni wai to heaven;
whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertin,
himself the primros path of dallianc tread
and reck not hi own read.

laer.
o, fear me not.
i stai too long:--but here my father come.

[enter poloniu.]

a doubl bless is a doubl grace;
occas smile upon a second leav.

pol.
yet here, laert! aboard, aboard, for shame!
the wind sit in the shoulder of your sail,
and you ar stai'd for. there,--my bless with thee!

[lai hi hand on laert's head.]

and these few precept in thy memori
look thou charact. give thy thought no tongu,
nor ani unproport'd thought hi act.
be thou familiar, but by no mean vulgar.
those friend thou hast, and their adopt tri,
grappl them unto thy soul with hoop of steel;
but do not dull thy palm with entertain
of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrad. bewar
of entranc to a quarrel; but, be in,
bear't that the oppos mai bewar of thee.
give everi man thine ear, but few thy voic:
take each man's censur, but reserv thy judgment.
costli thy habit as thy purs can bui,
but not express'd in fanci; rich, not gaudi:
for the apparel oft proclaim the man;
and thei in franc of the best rank and station
ar most select and gener chief in that.
neither a borrow nor a lender be:
for loan oft lose both itself and friend;
and borrow dull the edg of husbandri.
thi abov all,--to thine own self be true;
and it must follow, as the night the dai,
thou canst not then be fals to ani man.
farewel: my bless season thi in thee!

laer.
most humbl do i take my leav, my lord.

pol.
the time invit you; go, your servant tend.

laer.
farewel, ophelia; and rememb well
what i have said to you.

oph.
'ti in my memori lock'd,
and you yourself shall keep the kei of it.

laer.
farewel.

[exit.]

pol.
what is't, ophelia, he hath said to you?

oph.
so pleas you, someth touch the lord hamlet.

pol.
marri, well bethought:
'ti told me he hath veri oft of late
given privat time to you; and you yourself
have of your audienc been most free and bounteou;
if it be so,--as so 'ti put on me,
and that in wai of caution,--i must tell you
you do not understand yourself so clearli
as it behoov my daughter and your honour.
what is between you? give me up the truth.

oph.
he hath, my lord, of late made mani tender
of hi affect to me.

pol.
affect! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
unsift in such peril circumst.
do you believ hi tender, as you call them?

oph.
i do not know, my lord, what i should think.

pol.
marri, i'll teach you: think yourself a babi;
that you have ta'en these tender for true pai,
which ar not sterl. tender yourself more dearli;
or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
wrong it thu,--you'll tender me a fool.

oph.
my lord, he hath importun'd me with love
in honour fashion.

pol.
ay, fashion you mai call it; go to, go to.

oph.
and hath given counten to hi speech, my lord,
with almost all the holi vow of heaven.

pol.
ay, spring to catch woodcock. i do know,
when the blood burn, how prodig the soul
lend the tongu vow: these blaze, daughter,
give more light than heat,--extinct in both,
even in their promis, as it is a-make,--
you must not take for fire. from thi time
be someth scanter of your maiden presenc;
set your entreat at a higher rate
than a command to parlei. for lord hamlet,
believ so much in him, that he is young;
and with a larger tether mai he walk
than mai be given you: in few, ophelia,
do not believ hi vow; for thei ar broker,--
not of that dye which their invest show,
but mere implor of unholi suit,
breath like sanctifi and piou bawd,
the better to beguil. thi is for all,--
i would not, in plain term, from thi time forth
have you so slander ani moment leisur
as to give word or talk with the lord hamlet.
look to't, i charg you; come your wai.

oph.
i shall obei, my lord.

scene iv. the platform.

ham.
the air bite shrewdli; it is veri cold.

hor.
it is a nip and an eager air.

ham.
what hour now?

hor.
i think it lack of twelv.

mar.
no, it is struck.

hor.
inde? i heard it not: then draw near the season
wherein the spirit held hi wont to walk.

[a flourish of trumpet, and ordnanc shot off within.]

what doe thi mean, my lord?

ham.
the king doth wake to-night and take hi rous,
keep wassail, and the swagger up-spring reel;
and, as he drain hi draught of rhenish down,
the kettl-drum and trumpet thu brai out
the triumph of hi pledg.

hor.
is it a custom?

ham.
ay, marri, is't;
but to my mind,--though i am nativ here,
and to the manner born,--it is a custom
more honour'd in the breach than the observ.
thi heavi-head revel east and west
make us traduc'd and tax'd of other nation:
thei clepe us drunkard, and with swinish phrase
soil our addit; and, inde, it take
from our achiev, though perform'd at height,
the pith and marrow of our attribut.
so oft it chanc in particular men
that, for some viciou mole of natur in them,
as in their birth,--wherein thei ar not guilti,
sinc natur cannot choos hi origin,--
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
oft break down the pale and fort of reason;
or by some habit, that too much o'er-leaven
the form of plausiv manner;--that these men,--
carri, i sai, the stamp of on defect,
be natur's liveri, or fortun's star,--
their virtu els,--be thei as pure as grace,
as infinit as man mai undergo,--
shall in the gener censur take corrupt
from that particular fault: the dram of eal
doth all the nobl substanc often doubt
to hi own scandal.

hor.
look, my lord, it come!

[enter ghost.]

ham.
angel and minist of grace defend us!--
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
bring with thee air from heaven or blast from hell,
be thy intent wick or charit,
thou com'st in such a question shape
that i will speak to thee: i'll call thee hamlet,
king, father, royal dane; o, answer me!
let me not burst in ignor; but tell
why thy canoniz'd bone, hears in death,
have burst their cerement; why the sepulchr,
wherein we saw thee quietli in-urn'd,
hath op'd hi ponder and marbl jaw
to cast thee up again! what mai thi mean,
that thou, dead cors, again in complet steel,
revisit'st thu the glimps of the moon,
make night hideou, and we fool of natur
so horridli to shake our disposit
with thought beyond the reach of our soul?
sai, why is thi? wherefor? what should we do?

[ghost beckon hamlet.]

hor.
it beckon you to go awai with it,
as if it some impart did desir
to you alon.

mar.
look with what courteou action
it wave you to a more remov ground:
but do not go with it!

hor.
no, by no mean.

ham.
it will not speak; then will i follow it.

hor.
do not, my lord.

ham.
why, what should be the fear?
i do not set my life at a pin's fee;
and for my soul, what can it do to that,
be a thing immort as itself?
it wave me forth again;--i'll follow it.

hor.
what if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
or to the dread summit of the cliff
that beetl o'er hi base into the sea,
and there assum some other horribl form
which might depriv your sovereignti of reason,
and draw you into mad? think of it:
the veri place put toi of desper,
without more motiv, into everi brain
that look so mani fadom to the sea
and hear it roar beneath.

ham.
it wave me still.--
go on; i'll follow thee.

mar.
you shall not go, my lord.

ham.
hold off your hand.

hor.
be rul'd; you shall not go.

ham.

and make each petti arteri in thi bodi
as hardi as the nemean lion's nerv.--

[ghost beckon.]

still am i call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--

[break free from them.]

by heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that let me!--

[enter ghost and hamlet.]

ham.
whither wilt thou lead me? speak! i'll go no further.

ghost.
mark me.

ham.
i will.

ghost.
my hour is almost come,
when i to sulph'uou and torment flame
must render up myself.

ham.
ala, poor ghost!

ghost.
piti me not, but lend thy seriou hear
to what i shall unfold.

ham.
speak; i am bound to hear.

ghost.
so art thou to reveng, when thou shalt hear.

ham.
what?

ghost.
i am thy father's spirit;
doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
and for the dai confin'd to wastein fire,
till the foul crime done in my dai of natur
ar burnt and purg'd awai. but that i am forbid
to tell the secret of my prison-hous,
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul; freez thy young blood;
make thy two ey, like star, start from their sphere;
thy knot and combin lock to part,
and each particular hair to stand on end
like quill upon the fret porcupin:
but thi etern blazon must not be
to ear of flesh and blood.--list, list, o, list!--
if thou didst ever thy dear father love--

ham.
o god!

ghost.
reveng hi foul and most unnatur murder.

ham.
murder!

ghost.
murder most foul, as in the best it is;
but thi most foul, strang, and unnatur.

ham.
hast me to know't, that i, with wing as swift
as medit or the thought of love,
mai sweep to my reveng.

ghost.
i find thee apt;
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that rot itself in eas on leth wharf,
wouldst thou not stir in thi. now, hamlet, hear.
'ti given out that, sleep in my orchard,
a serpent stung me; so the whole ear of denmark
is by a forg process of my death
rankli abu'd; but know, thou nobl youth,
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wear hi crown.

ham.
o my prophet soul!
mine uncl!

ghost.
ay, that incestu, that adulter beast,
with witchcraft of hi wit, with traitor gift,--
o wick wit and gift, that have the power
so to seduc!--won to hi shame lust
the will of my most seem-virtuou queen:
o hamlet, what a fall-off wa there!
from me, whose love wa of that digniti
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriag; and to declin
upon a wretch whose natur gift were poor
to those of mine!
but virtu, as it never will be mov'd,
though lewd court it in a shape of heaven;
so lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
will sate itself in a celesti bed
and prei on garbag.
but soft! methink i scent the morn air;
brief let me be.--sleep within my orchard,
my custom alwai of the afternoon,
upon my secur hour thy uncl stole,
with juic of curs hebenon in a vial,
and in the porch of my ear did pour
the leper distil; whose effect
hold such an enmiti with blood of man
that, swift as quicksilv, it cours through
the natur gate and allei of the bodi;
and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
and curd, like eager drop into milk,
the thin and wholesom blood; so did it mine;
and a most instant tetter bark'd about,
most lazar-like, with vile and loathsom crust
all my smooth bodi.
thu wa i, sleep, by a brother's hand,
of life, of crown, of queen, at onc dispatch'd:
cut off even in the blossom of my sin,
unhou'led, disappoint, unanel'd;
no reckon made, but sent to my account
with all my imperfect on my head:
o, horribl! o, horribl! most horribl!
if thou hast natur in thee, bear it not;
let not the royal bed of denmark be
a couch for luxuri and damn incest.
but, howsoev thou pursu'st thi act,
taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contriv
against thy mother aught: leav her to heaven,
and to those thorn that in her bosom lodg,
to prick and sting her. fare thee well at onc!
the glowworm show the matin to be near,
and 'gin to pale hi uneffectu fire:
adieu, adieu! hamlet, rememb me.

[exit.]

ham.
o all you host of heaven! o earth! what els?
and shall i coupl hell? o, fie!--hold, my heart;
and you, my sinew, grow not instant old,
but bear me stiffli up.--rememb thee!
ay, thou poor ghost, while memori hold a seat
in thi distract globe. rememb thee!
yea, from the tabl of my memori
i'll wipe awai all trivial fond record,
all saw of book, all form, all pressur past,
that youth and observ copi there;
and thy command all alon shall live
within the book and volum of my brain,
unmix'd with baser matter: ye, by heaven!--
o most pernici woman!
o villain, villain, smile, damn villain!

and in part him;--do you mark thi, reynaldo?

rei.
ay, veri well, my lord.

pol.
'and in part him;--but,' you mai sai, 'not well:
but if't be he i mean, he's veri wild;
addict so and so;' and there put on him
what forgeri you pleas; marri, none so rank
as mai dishonour him; take heed of that;
but, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slip
as ar companion note and most known
to youth and liberti.

rei.
as game, my lord.

pol.
ay, or drink, fenc, swear, quarrel,
drab:--you mai go so far.

rei.
my lord, that would dishonour him.

pol.
faith, no; as you mai season it in the charg.
you must not put anoth scandal on him,
that he is open to incontin;
that's not my mean: but breath hi fault so quaintli
that thei mai seem the taint of liberti;
the flash and outbreak of a fieri mind;
a savag in unreclaim blood,
of gener assault.

rei.
but, my good lord,--

pol.
wherefor should you do thi?

rei.
ay, my lord,
i would know that.

pol.
marri, sir, here's my drift;
and i believ it is a fetch of warrant:
you lai these slight sulli on my son
as 'twere a thing a littl soil'd i' the work,
mark you,
your parti in convers, him you would sound,
have ever seen in the prenomin crime
the youth you breath of guilti, be assur'd
he close with you in thi consequ;
'good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
accord to the phrase or the addit
of man and countri.

rei.
veri good, my lord.

pol.
and then, sir, doe he thi,--he doe--what wa i about to sai?--
by the mass, i wa about to sai someth:--where did i leav?

rei.
at 'close in the consequ,' at 'friend or so,' and
gentleman.'

pol.
at--close in the consequ'--ay, marri!
he close with you thu:--'i know the gentleman;
i saw him yesterdai, or t'other dai,
or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you sai,
there wa he game; there o'ertook in's rous;
there fall out at tenni': or perchanc,
'i saw him enter such a hous of sale,'--
videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
see you now;
your bait of falsehood take thi carp of truth:
and thu do we of wisdom and of reach,
with windlac, and with assai of bia,
by indirect find direct out:
so, by my former lectur and advic,
shall you my son. you have me, have you not?

rei.
my lord, i have.

pol.
god b' wi' you, fare you well.

rei.
good my lord!

pol.
observ hi inclin in yourself.

rei.
i shall, my lord.

pol.
and let him ply hi music.

rei.
well, my lord.

pol.
farewel!

[exit reynaldo.]

[enter ophelia.]

how now, ophelia! what's the matter?

oph.
ala, my lord, i have been so affright!

pol.
with what, i' the name of god?

oph.
my lord, as i wa sew in my chamber,
lord hamlet,--with hi doublet all unbrac'd;
no hat upon hi head; hi stock foul'd,
ungart'red, and down-gyve to hi ankl;
pale as hi shirt; hi knee knock each other;
and with a look so piteou in purport
as if he had been loos out of hell
to speak of horror,--he come befor me.

pol.
mad for thy love?

oph.
my lord, i do not know;
but truli i do fear it.

pol.
what said he?

oph.
he took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
then goe he to the length of all hi arm;
and with hi other hand thu o'er hi brow,
he fall to such perus of my face
as he would draw it. long stai'd he so;
at last,--a littl shake of mine arm,
and thrice hi head thu wave up and down,--
he rai'd a sigh so piteou and profound
as it did seem to shatter all hi bulk
and end hi be: that done, he let me go:
and, with hi head over hi shoulder turn'd
he seem'd to find hi wai without hi ey;
for out o' door he went without their help,
and to the last bend their light on me.

pol.
come, go with me: i will go seek the king.
thi is the veri ecstasi of love;
whose violent properti fordo itself,
and lead the will to desper undertak,
as oft as ani passion under heaven
that doe afflict our natur. i am sorri,--
what, have you given him ani hard word of late?

oph.
no, my good lord; but, as you did command,
i did repel hi letter and deni
hi access to me.

pol.
that hath made him mad.
i am sorri that with better heed and judgment
i had not quot him: i fear'd he did but trifl,
and meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousi!
it seem it as proper to our ag
to cast beyond ourselv in our opinion
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discret. come, go we to the king:
thi must be known; which, be kept close, might move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love.

king.
welcom, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern!
moreov that we much did long to see you,
the need we have to us you did provok
our hasti send. someth have you heard
of hamlet's transform; so i call it,
sinc nor the exterior nor the inward man
resembl that it wa. what it should be,
more than hi father's death, that thu hath put him
so much from the understand of himself,
i cannot dream of: i entreat you both
that, be of so young dai brought up with him,
and sinc so neighbour'd to hi youth and humour,
that you vouchsaf your rest here in our court
some littl time: so by your compani
to draw him on to pleasur, and to gather,
so much as from occas you mai glean,
whether aught, to us unknown, afflict him thu,
that, open'd, li within our remedi.

queen.
good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
and sure i am two men there ar not live
to whom he more adher. if it will pleas you
to show us so much gentri and good-will
as to expend your time with us awhil,
for the suppli and profit of our hope,
your visit shall receiv such thank
as fit a king's remembr.

ro.
both your majesti
might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
put your dread pleasur more into command
than to entreati.

and here give up ourselv, in the full bent,
to lai our servic freeli at your feet,
to be command.

and i beseech you instantli to visit

and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.

thou still hast been the father of good new.

pol.

i hold my duti, as i hold my soul,
both to my god and to my graciou king:
and i do think,--or els thi brain of mine
hunt not the trail of polici so sure
as it hath us'd to do,--that i have found
the veri caus of hamlet's lunaci.

king.
o, speak of that; that do i long to hear.

pol.
give first admitt to the ambassador;
my new shall be the fruit to that great feast.

king.

[exit poloniu.]

he tell me, my sweet queen, he hath found
the head and sourc of all your son's distemp.

queen.
i doubt it is no other but the main,--
hi father's death and our o'erhasti marriag.

king.
well, we shall sift him.

[enter poloniu, with voltimand and corneliu.]

welcom, my good friend!
sai, voltimand, what from our brother norwai?

volt.
most fair return of greet and desir.
upon our first, he sent out to suppress
hi nephew's levi; which to him appear'd
to be a prepar 'gainst the polack;
but, better look'd into, he truli found
it wa against your high; whereat griev'd,--
that so hi sick, ag, and impot
wa fals born in hand,--send out arrest
on fortinbra; which he, in brief, obei;
receiv rebuk from norwai; and, in fine,
make vow befor hi uncl never more
to give th' assai of arm against your majesti.
whereon old norwai, overcom with joi,
give him three thousand crown in annual fee;
and hi commiss to emploi those soldier,
so levi as befor, against the polack:
with an entreati, herein further shown,
[give a paper.]
that it might pleas you to give quiet pass
through your dominion for thi enterpris,
on such regard of safeti and allow
as therein ar set down.

king.
it like us well;
and at our more consid'd time we'll read,
answer, and think upon thi busi.
meantim we thank you for your well-took labour:
go to your rest; at night we'll feast togeth:
most welcom home!

[exeunt voltimand and corneliu.]

pol.
thi busi is well end.--
my lieg, and madam,--to expostul
what majesti should be, what duti is,
why dai is dai, night is night, and time is time.
were noth but to wast night, dai, and time.
therefor, sinc breviti is the soul of wit,
and tedious the limb and outward flourish,
i will be brief:--your nobl son is mad:
mad call i it; for to defin true mad,
what is't but to be noth els but mad?
but let that go.

queen.
more matter, with less art.

pol.
madam, i swear i us no art at all.
that he is mad, 'ti true: 'ti true 'ti piti;
and piti 'ti 'ti true: a foolish figur;
but farewel it, for i will us no art.
mad let us grant him then: and now remain
that we find out the caus of thi effect;
or rather sai, the caus of thi defect,
for thi effect defect come by caus:
thu it remain, and the remaind thu.
perpend.
i have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--
who, in her duti and obedi, mark,
hath given me thi: now gather, and surmis.
[read.]
'to the celesti, and my soul's idol, the most beautifi
ophelia,'--
that's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautifi' is a vile
phrase: but you shall hear. thu:
[read.]
'in her excel white bosom, these, &c.'

queen.
came thi from hamlet to her?

pol.
good madam, stai awhil; i will be faith.
[read.]
  'doubt thou the star ar fire;
     doubt that the sun doth move;
   doubt truth to be a liar;
     but never doubt i love.
'o dear ophelia, i am ill at these number; i have not art to
reckon my groan: but that i love thee best, o most best, believ
it. adieu.
  'thine evermor, most dear ladi, whilst thi machin is to him,
     hamlet.'
thi, in obedi, hath my daughter show'd me;
and more abov, hath hi solicit,
as thei fell out by time, by mean, and place,
all given to mine ear.

king.
but how hath she
receiv'd hi love?

pol.
what do you think of me?

king.
as of a man faith and honour.

pol.
i would fain prove so. but what might you think,
when i had seen thi hot love on the wing,--
as i perceiv'd it, i must tell you that,
befor my daughter told me,-- what might you,
or my dear majesti your queen here, think,
if i had plai'd the desk or tabl-book,
or given my heart a wink, mute and dumb;
or look'd upon thi love with idl sight;--
what might you think? no, i went round to work,
and my young mistress thu i did bespeak:
'lord hamlet is a princ, out of thy sphere;
thi must not be:' and then i precept gave her,
that she should lock herself from hi resort,
admit no messeng, receiv no token.
which done, she took the fruit of my advic;
and he, repuls,--a short tale to make,--
fell into a sad; then into a fast;
thenc to a watch; thenc into a weak;
thenc to a light; and, by thi declens,
into the mad wherein now he rave,
and all we wail for.

king.
do you think 'ti thi?

queen.
it mai be, veri like.

pol.
hath there been such a time,--i'd fain know that--
that i have posit said ''ti so,'
when it prov'd otherwis?

king.
not that i know.

pol.
take thi from thi, if thi be otherwis:
[point to hi head and shoulder.]
if circumst lead me, i will find
where truth is hid, though it were hid inde
within the centr.

king.
how mai we try it further?

pol.
you know sometim he walk for hour togeth
here in the lobbi.

queen.
so he doe inde.

pol.
at such a time i'll loos my daughter to him:
be you and i behind an arra then;
mark the encount: if he love her not,
and he not from hi reason fall'n thereon
let me be no assist for a state,
but keep a farm and carter.

king.
we will try it.

queen.
but look where sadli the poor wretch come read.

pol.
awai, i do beseech you, both awai
i'll board him present:--o, give me leav.

[exeunt king, queen, and attend.]

[enter hamlet, read.]

how doe my good lord hamlet?

ham.
well, god-a-merci.

pol.
do you know me, my lord?

ham.
excel well; you're a fishmong.

pol.
not i, my lord.

ham.
then i would you were so honest a man.

pol.
honest, my lord!

ham.
ay, sir; to be honest, as thi world goe, is to be on man
pick out of ten thousand.

pol.
that's veri true, my lord.

ham.
for if the sun breed maggot in a dead dog, be a god-kiss
carrion,--have you a daughter?

pol.
i have, my lord.

ham.
let her not walk i' the sun: concept is a bless, but not
as your daughter mai conceiv:--friend, look to't.

pol.
how sai you by that?--[asid.] still harp on my daughter:--yet
he knew me not at first; he said i wa a fishmong: he is far
gone, far gone: and truli in my youth i suffer much extrem
for love; veri near thi. i'll speak to him again.--what do you
read, my lord?

ham.
word, word, word.

pol.
what is the matter, my lord?

ham.
between who?

pol.
i mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

ham.
slander, sir: for the satir slave sai here that old men
have grei beard; that their face ar wrinkl; their ey
purg thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that thei have a
plenti lack of wit, togeth with most weak ham: all which,
sir, though i most powerfulli and potent believ, yet i hold it
not honesti to have it thu set down; for you yourself, sir,
should be old as i am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.

pol.
[asid.] though thi be mad, yet there is a method in't.--
will you walk out of the air, my lord?

ham.
into my grave?

pol.
inde, that is out o' the air. [asid.] how pregnant sometim
hi repli ar! a happi that often mad hit on, which
reason and saniti could not so prosper be deliv of. i
will leav him and suddenli contriv the mean of meet between
him and my daughter.--my honour lord, i will most humbl take
my leav of you.

ham.
you cannot, sir, take from me anyth that i will more
willingli part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my
life.

pol.
fare you well, my lord.

ham.
these tediou old fool!

[enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.]

pol.
you go to seek the lord hamlet; there he is.

ro.
[to poloniu.] god save you, sir!

[exit poloniu.]

guil.
my honour lord!

ro.
my most dear lord!

ham.
my excel good friend! how dost thou, guildenstern? ah,
rosencrantz! good lad, how do ye both?

ro.
as the indiffer children of the earth.

guil.
happi in that we ar not over-happi;
on fortun's cap we ar not the veri button.

ham.
nor the sole of her shoe?

ro.
neither, my lord.

ham.
then you live about her waist, or in the middl of her
favour?

guil.
faith, her privat we.

ham.
in the secret part of fortun? o, most true; she is a
strumpet. what's the new?

ro.
none, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

ham.
then is doomsdai near; but your new is not true. let me
question more in particular: what have you, my good friend,
deserv at the hand of fortun, that she send you to prison
hither?

guil.
prison, my lord!

ham.
denmark's a prison.

ro.
then is the world on.

ham.
a goodli on; in which there ar mani confin, ward, and
dungeon, denmark be on o' the worst.

ro.
we think not so, my lord.

ham.
why, then 'ti none to you; for there is noth either good
or bad but think make it so: to me it is a prison.

ro.
why, then, your ambit make it on; 'ti too narrow for your
mind.

ham.
o god, i could be bound in a nutshel, and count myself a
king of infinit space, were it not that i have bad dream.

guil.
which dream, inde, ar ambit; for the veri substanc of
the ambiti is mere the shadow of a dream.

ham.
a dream itself is but a shadow.

ro.
truli, and i hold ambit of so airi and light a qualiti that
it is but a shadow's shadow.

ham.
then ar our beggar bodi, and our monarch and outstretch'd
hero the beggar' shadow. shall we to the court? for, by my
fai, i cannot reason.

ro. and guild.
we'll wait upon you.

ham.
no such matter: i will not sort you with the rest of my
servant; for, to speak to you like an honest man, i am most
dreadfulli attend. but, in the beaten wai of friendship, what
make you at elsinor?

ro.
to visit you, my lord; no other occas.

ham.
beggar that i am, i am even poor in thank; but i thank you:
and sure, dear friend, my thank ar too dear a halfpenni. were
you not sent for? is it your own inclin? is it a free
visit? come, deal justli with me: come, come; nai, speak.

guil.
what should we sai, my lord?

ham.
why, anyth--but to the purpos. you were sent for; and
there is a kind of confess in your look, which your modesti
have not craft enough to colour: i know the good king and queen
have sent for you.

ro.
to what end, my lord?

ham.
that you must teach me. but let me conjur you, by the right
of our fellowship, by the conson of our youth, by the
oblig of our ever-preserv love, and by what more dear a
better propos could charg you withal, be even and direct with
me, whether you were sent for or no.

ro.
[to guildenstern.] what sai you?

ham.
[asid.] nai, then, i have an ey of you.--if you love me, hold
not off.

guil.
my lord, we were sent for.

ham.
i will tell you why; so shall my anticip prevent your
discoveri, and your secreci to the king and queen moult no
feather. i have of late,--but wherefor i know not,--lost all my
mirth, forgon all custom of exercis; and inde, it goe so
heavili with my disposit that thi goodli frame, the earth,
seem to me a steril promontori; thi most excel canopi, the
air, look you, thi brave o'erhang firmament, thi majest
roof fret with golden fire,--why, it appear no other thing
to me than a foul and pestil congreg of vapour. what a
piec of work is man! how nobl in reason! how infinit in
faculti! in form and move, how express and admir! in
action how like an angel! in apprehens, how like a god! the
beauti of the world! the paragon of anim! and yet, to me, what
is thi quintess of dust? man delight not me; no, nor woman
neither, though by your smile you seem to sai so.

ro.
my lord, there wa no such stuff in my thought.

ham.
why did you laugh then, when i said 'man delight not me'?

ro.
to think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
entertain the player shall receiv from you: we cote them
on the wai; and hither ar thei come to offer you servic.

ham.
he that plai the king shall be welcom,--hi majesti shall
have tribut of me; the adventur knight shall us hi foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh grati; the humor man shall
end hi part in peac; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lung ar tickl o' the sere; and the ladi shall sai her mind
freeli, or the blank vers shall halt for't. what player ar
thei?

ro.
even those you were wont to take such delight in,--the
tragedian of the citi.

ham.
how chanc it thei travel? their resid, both in
reput and profit, wa better both wai.

ro.
i think their inhibit come by the mean of the late
innov.

ham.
do thei hold the same estim thei did when i wa in the
citi? ar thei so follow?

ro.
no, inde, ar thei not.

ham.
how come it? do thei grow rusti?

ro.
nai, their endeavour keep in the wont pace: but there is,
sir, an aeri of children, littl eyas, that cry out on the top
of question, and ar most tyrann clap for't: these ar
now the fashion; and so berattl the common stage,--so thei call
them,--that mani wear rapier ar afraid of goos-quill and
dare scarc come thither.

ham.
what, ar thei children? who maintain 'em? how ar thei
escot? will thei pursu the qualiti no longer than thei can
sing? will thei not sai afterward, if thei should grow
themselv to common player,--as it is most like, if their mean
ar no better,--their writer do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own success?

ro.
faith, there ha been much to do on both side; and the nation
hold it no sin to tarr them to controversi: there wa, for
awhil, no monei bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuff in the question.

ham.
is't possibl?

guil.
o, there ha been much throw about of brain.

ham.
do the boi carri it awai?

ro.
ay, that thei do, my lord; hercul and hi load too.

ham.
it is not veri strang; for my uncl is king of denmark, and
those that would make mouth at him while my father live, give
twenti, forti, fifti, a hundr ducat a-piec for hi pictur in
littl. 'sblood, there is someth in thi more than natur, if
philosophi could find it out.

[flourish of trumpet within.]

guil.
there ar the player.

ham.
gentlemen, you ar welcom to elsinor. your hand, come: the
appurten of welcom is fashion and ceremoni: let me compli
with you in thi garb; lest my extent to the player, which i
tell you must show fairli outward, should more appear like
entertain than your. you ar welcom: but my uncl-father
and aunt-mother ar deceiv.

guil.
in what, my dear lord?

ham.
i am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerli i
know a hawk from a handsaw.

[enter poloniu.]

pol.
well be with you, gentlemen!

ham.
hark you, guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that
great babi you see there is not yet out of hi swaddl clout.

ro.
happili he's the second time come to them; for thei sai an old
man is twice a child.

ham.
i will prophesi he come to tell me of the player; mark it.--you
sai right, sir: o' mondai morn; 'twa so inde.

pol.
my lord, i have new to tell you.

ham.
my lord, i have new to tell you. when rosciu wa an actor in
rome,--

pol.
the actor ar come hither, my lord.

ham.
buzz, buzz!

pol.
upon my honour,--

ham.
then came each actor on hi ass,--

pol.
the best actor in the world, either for tragedi, comedi,
histori, pastor, pastor-comic, histor-pastor,
tragic-histor, tragic-comic-histor-pastor, scene
individ, or poem unlimit: seneca cannot be too heavi nor
plautu too light. for the law of writ and the liberti, these ar
the onli men.

ham.
o jephthah, judg of israel, what a treasur hadst thou!

pol.
what treasur had he, my lord?

ham.
why--
   'on fair daughter, and no more,
   the which he love pass well.'


pol.
[asid.] still on my daughter.

ham.
am i not i' the right, old jephthah?

pol.
if you call me jephthah, my lord, i have a daughter that i
love pass well.

ham.
nai, that follow not.

pol.
what follow, then, my lord?

ham.
why--
   'as by lot, god wot,'
and then, you know,
   'it came to pass, as most like it wa--'
the first row of the piou chanson will show you more; for look
where my abridg come.

[enter four or five player.]

you ar welcom, master; welcom, all:--i am glad to see thee
well.--welcom, good friend.--o, my old friend! thy face is
valanc'd sinc i saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
denmark?--what, my young ladi and mistress! by'r ladi, your
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last, by the
altitud of a chopin. prai god, your voic, like a piec of
uncurr gold, be not crack within the ring.--master, you ar
all welcom. we'll e'en to't like french falcon, fly at
anyth we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a
tast of your qualiti: come, a passion speech.

i plai.
what speech, my lord?

ham.
i heard thee speak me a speech onc,--but it wa never act;
or if it wa, not abov onc; for the plai, i rememb, pleas
not the million, 'twa caviar to the gener; but it wa,--as i
receiv it, and other, whose judgment in such matter cri in
the top of mine,--an excel plai, well digest in the scene,
set down with as much modesti as cun. i rememb, on said
there were no sallet in the line to make the matter savouri,
nor no matter in the phrase that might indit the author of
affect; but call it an honest method, as wholesom as
sweet, and by veri much more handsom than fine. on speech in it
i chiefli love: 'twa aenea' tale to dido, and thereabout of it
especi where he speak of priam's slaughter: if it live in
your memori, begin at thi line;--let me see, let me see:--

the rug pyrrhu, like th' hyrcanian beast,--

it is not so:-- it begin with pyrrhu:--

  'the rug pyrrhu,--he whose sabl arm,
   black as hi purpos, did the night resembl
   when he lai couch in the omin hors,--
   hath now thi dread and black complexion smear'd
   with heraldri more dismal; head to foot
   now is he total gule; horridli trick'd
   with blood of father, mother, daughter, son,
   bak'd and impast with the parch street,
   that lend a tyrann and a damn light
   to their vile murder: roast in wrath and fire,
   and thu o'ersiz with coagul gore,
   with ey like carbuncl, the hellish pyrrhu
   old grandsir priam seek.'

so, proce you.

pol.
'fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
discret.

i plai.
   anon he find him,
   strike too short at greek: hi antiqu sword,
   rebelli to hi arm, li where it fall,
   repugn to command: unequ match'd,
   pyrrhu at priam drive; in rage strike wide;
   but with the whiff and wind of hi fell sword
   the unnerv father fall. then senseless ilium,
   seem to feel thi blow, with flame top
   stoop to hi base; and with a hideou crash
   take prison pyrrhu' ear: for lo! hi sword,
   which wa declin on the milki head
   of reverend priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
   so, as a paint tyrant, pyrrhu stood;
   and, like a neutral to hi will and matter,
   did noth.
   but as we often see, against some storm,
   a silenc in the heaven, the rack stand still,
   the bold wind speechless, and the orb below
   as hush as death, anon the dread thunder
   doth rend the region; so, after pyrrhu' paus,
   a rous vengeanc set him new a-work;
   and never did the cyclop' hammer fall
   on mar's armour, forg'd for proof etern,
   with less remors than pyrrhu' bleed sword
   now fall on priam.--
   out, out, thou strumpet, fortun! all you god,
   in gener synod, take awai her power;
   break all the spoke and felli from her wheel,
   and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
   as low as to the fiend!

pol.
thi is too long.

ham.
it shall to the barber's, with your beard.--pr'ythee sai on.--
he's for a jig or a tale of bawdri, or he sleep:--sai on; come
to hecuba.

i plai.
   but who, o who, had seen the mobl queen,--

ham.
'the mobl queen'?

pol.
that's good! 'mobl queen' is good.

i plai.
   run barefoot up and down, threaten the flame
   with bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
   where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
   about her lank and all o'erteem loin,
   a blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--
   who thi had seen, with tongu in venom steep'd,
   'gainst fortun's state would treason have pronounc'd:
   but if the god themselv did see her then,
   when she saw pyrrhu make malici sport
   in minc with hi sword her husband's limb,
   the instant burst of clamour that she made,--
   unless thing mortal move them not at all,--
   would have made milch the burn ey of heaven,
   and passion in the god.

pol.
look, whether he ha not turn'd hi colour, and ha tear in's
ey.--prai you, no more!

ham.
'ti well. i'll have thee speak out the rest of thi soon.--
good my lord, will you see the player well bestow? do you
hear? let them be well us; for thei ar the abstract and brief
chronicl of the time; after your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.

pol.
my lord, i will us them accord to their desert.

ham.
odd's bodikin, man, better: us everi man after hi
desert, and who should scape whip? us them after your own
honour and digniti: the less thei deserv, the more merit is in
your bounti. take them in.

pol.
come, sir.

ham.
follow him, friend: we'll hear a plai to-morrow.

[exeunt poloniu with all the player but the first.]

dost thou hear me, old friend? can you plai 'the murder of
gonzago'?

i plai.
ay, my lord.

ham.
we'll ha't to-morrow night. you could, for a need, studi a
speech of some dozen or sixteen line which i would set down and
insert in't? could you not?

i plai.
ay, my lord.

ham.
veri well.--follow that lord; and look you mock him not.

[exit first player.]

--my good friend [to ro. and guild.], i'll leav you till
night: you ar welcom to elsinor.

ro.
good my lord!

[exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern.]

ham.
ay, so, god b' wi' ye!
now i am alon.
o, what a rogu and peasant slave am i!
is it not monstrou that thi player here,
but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
could forc hi soul so to hi own conceit
that from her work all hi visag wan'd;
tear in hi ey, distract in's aspect,
a broken voic, and hi whole function suit
with form to hi conceit? and all for noth!
for hecuba?
what's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba,
that he should weep for her? what would he do,
had he the motiv and the cue for passion
that i have? he would drown the stage with tear
and cleav the gener ear with horrid speech;
make mad the guilti, and appal the free;
confound the ignor, and amaz, inde,
the veri faculti of ey and ear.
yet i,
a dull and muddi-mettl rascal, peak,
like john-a-dream, unpregn of my caus,
and can sai noth; no, not for a king
upon whose properti and most dear life
a damn'd defeat wa made. am i a coward?
who call me villain? break my pate across?
pluck off my beard and blow it in my face?
tweak me by the nose? give me the lie i' the throat
as deep as to the lung? who doe me thi, ha?
'swound, i should take it: for it cannot be
but i am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
to make oppress bitter; or er thi
i should have fat all the region kite
with thi slave's offal: bloodi, bawdi villain!
remorseless, treacher, lecher, kindless villain!
o, vengeanc!
why, what an ass am i! thi is most brave,
that i, the son of a dear father murder'd,
prompt to my reveng by heaven and hell,
must, like a whore, unpack my heart with word
and fall a-curs like a veri drab,
a scullion!
fie upon't! foh!--about, my brain! i have heard
that guilti creatur, sit at a plai,
have by the veri cun of the scene
been struck so to the soul that present
thei have proclaim'd their malefact;
for murder, though it have no tongu, will speak
with most miracul organ, i'll have these player
plai someth like the murder of my father
befor mine uncl: i'll observ hi look;
i'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
i know my cours. the spirit that i have seen
mai be the devil: and the devil hath power
to assum a pleas shape; yea, and perhap
out of my weak and my melancholi,--
as he is veri potent with such spirit,--
abus me to damn me: i'll have ground
more rel than thi.--the plai's the thing
wherein i'll catch the conscienc of the king.

act iii.

scene i. a room in the castl.

[enter king, queen, poloniu, ophelia, rosencrantz, and
guildenstern.]

king.
and can you, by no drift of circumst,
get from him why he put on thi confus,
grate so harshli all hi dai of quiet
with turbul and danger lunaci?

ro.
he doe confess he feel himself distract,
but from what caus he will by no mean speak.

guil.
nor do we find him forward to be sound,
but, with a crafti mad, keep aloof
when we would bring him on to some confess
of hi true state.

queen.
did he receiv you well?

ro.
most like a gentleman.

guil.
but with much forc of hi disposit.

ro.
niggard of question; but, of our demand,
most free in hi repli.

queen.
did you assai him
to ani pastim?

ro.
madam, it so fell out that certain player
we o'er-raught on the wai: of these we told him,
and there did seem in him a kind of joi
to hear of it: thei ar about the court,
and, as i think, thei have alreadi order
thi night to plai befor him.

pol.
'ti most true;
and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesti
to hear and see the matter.

king.
with all my heart; and it doth much content me
to hear him so inclin'd.--
good gentlemen, give him a further edg,
and drive hi purpos on to these delight.

ro.
we shall, my lord.

[exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern.]

king.
sweet gertrud, leav us too;
for we have close sent for hamlet hither,
that he, as 'twere by accid, mai here
affront ophelia:
her father and myself,--law espial,--
will so bestow ourselv that, see, unseen,
we mai of their encount frankli judg;
and gather by him, as he is behav'd,
if't be the afflict of hi love or no
that thu he suffer for.

queen.
i shall obei you:--
and for your part, ophelia, i do wish
that your good beauti be the happi caus
of hamlet's wild: so shall i hope your virtu
will bring him to hi wont wai again,
to both your honour.

oph.
madam, i wish it mai.

[exit queen.]

pol.
ophelia, walk you here.--graciou, so pleas you,
we will bestow ourselv.--[to ophelia.] read on thi book;
that show of such an exercis mai colour
your loneli.--we ar oft to blame in thi,--
'ti too much prov'd,--that with devot's visag
and piou action we do sugar o'er
the devil himself.

king.
[asid.] o, 'ti too true!
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscienc!
the harlot's cheek, beauti with plaster art,
is not more ugli to the thing that help it
than is my deed to my most paint word:
o heavi burden!

pol.
i hear him come: let's withdraw, my lord.

[exeunt king and poloniu.]

[enter hamlet.]

ham.
to be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
whether 'ti nobler in the mind to suffer
the sling and arrow of outrag fortun
or to take arm against a sea of troubl,
and by oppos end them?--to die,--to sleep,--
no more; and by a sleep to sai we end
the heartach, and the thousand natur shock
that flesh is heir to,--'ti a consumm
devoutli to be wish'd. to die,--to sleep;--
to sleep! perchanc to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
for in that sleep of death what dream mai come,
when we have shuffl off thi mortal coil,
must give us paus: there's the respect
that make calam of so long life;
for who would bear the whip and scorn of time,
the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contum,
the pang of despi'd love, the law's delai,
the insol of offic, and the spurn
that patient merit of the unworthi take,
when he himself might hi quietu make
with a bare bodkin? who would these fardel bear,
to grunt and sweat under a weari life,
but that the dread of someth after death,--
the undiscov'd countri, from whose bourn
no travel return,--puzzl the will,
and make us rather bear those ill we have
than fly to other that we know not of?
thu conscienc doe make coward of us all;
and thu the nativ hue of resolut
is sickli o'er with the pale cast of thought;
and enterpris of great pith and moment,
with thi regard, their current turn awri,
and lose the name of action.--soft you now!
the fair ophelia!--nymph, in thy orison
be all my sin rememb'd.

oph.
good my lord,
how doe your honour for thi mani a dai?

ham.
i humbl thank you; well, well, well.

oph.
my lord, i have remembr of your
that i have long long to re-deliv.
i prai you, now receiv them.

ham.
no, not i;
i never gave you aught.

oph.
my honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
and with them word of so sweet breath compo'd
as made the thing more rich; their perfum lost,
take these again; for to the nobl mind
rich gift wax poor when giver prove unkind.
there, my lord.

ham.
ha, ha! ar you honest?

oph.
my lord?

ham.
ar you fair?

oph.
what mean your lordship?

ham.
that if you be honest and fair, your honesti should admit no
discours to your beauti.

oph.
could beauti, my lord, have better commerc than with honesti?

ham.
ay, truli; for the power of beauti will sooner transform
honesti from what it is to a bawd than the forc of honesti can
translat beauti into hi like: thi wa sometim a paradox,
but now the time give it proof. i did love you onc.

oph.
inde, my lord, you made me believ so.

ham.
you should not have believ'd me; for virtu cannot so
inocul our old stock but we shall relish of it: i love you
not.

oph.
i wa the more deceiv.

ham.
get thee to a nunneri: why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinner? i am myself indiffer honest; but yet i could accus
me of such thing that it were better my mother had not born me:
i am veri proud, reveng, ambiti; with more offenc at my
beck than i have thought to put them in, imagin to give
them shape, or time to act them in. what should such fellow as i
do crawl between earth and heaven? we ar arrant knave, all;
believ none of us. go thy wai to a nunneri. where's your
father?

oph.
at home, my lord.

ham.
let the door be shut upon him, that he mai plai the fool
nowher but in's own hous. farewel.

oph.
o, help him, you sweet heaven!

ham.
if thou dost marri, i'll give thee thi plagu for thy dowri,--
be thou as chast as ic, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escap
calumni. get thee to a nunneri, go: farewel. or, if thou wilt
need marri, marri a fool; for wise men know well enough what
monster you make of them. to a nunneri, go; and quickli too.
farewel.

oph.
o heavenli power, restor him!

ham.
i have heard of your paint too, well enough; god hath
given you on face, and you make yourselv anoth: you jig, you
ambl, and you lisp, and nicknam god's creatur, and make your
wanton your ignor. go to, i'll no more on't; it hath made
me mad. i sai, we will have no more marriag: those that ar
marri alreadi, all but on, shall live; the rest shall keep as
thei ar. to a nunneri, go.

[exit.]

oph.
o, what a nobl mind is here o'erthrown!
the courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, ey, tongu, sword,
the expect and rose of the fair state,
the glass of fashion and the mould of form,
the observ'd of all observ,--quit, quit down!
and i, of ladi most deject and wretch
that suck'd the honei of hi music vow,
now see that nobl and most sovereign reason,
like sweet bell jangl, out of tune and harsh;
that unmatch'd form and featur of blown youth
blast with ecstasi: o, woe is me,
to have seen what i have seen, see what i see!

[re-enter king and poloniu.]

king.
love! hi affect do not that wai tend;
nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a littl,
wa not like mad. there's someth in hi soul
o'er which hi melancholi sit on brood;
and i do doubt the hatch and the disclos
will be some danger: which for to prevent,
i have in quick determin
thu set it down:--he shall with speed to england
for the demand of our neglect tribut:
hapli the sea, and countri differ,
with variabl object, shall expel
thi someth-settl matter in hi heart;
whereon hi brain still beat put him thu
from fashion of himself. what think you on't?

pol.
it shall do well: but yet do i believ
the origin and commenc of hi grief
sprung from neglect love.--how now, ophelia!
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said;
we heard it all.--my lord, do as you pleas;
but if you hold it fit, after the plai,
let hi queen mother all alon entreat him
to show hi grief: let her be round with him;
and i'll be plac'd, so pleas you, in the ear
of all their confer. if she find him not,
to england send him; or confin him where
your wisdom best shall think.

king.
it shall be so:
mad in great on must not unwatch'd go.

[exeunt.]



scene ii. a hall in the castl.

[enter hamlet and certain player.]

ham.
speak the speech, i prai you, as i pronounc it to you,
trippingli on the tongu: but if you mouth it, as mani of your
player do, i had as lief the town crier spoke my line. nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thu, but us all
gentli: for in the veri torrent, tempest, and, as i mai sai,
whirlwind of passion, you must acquir and beget a
temper that mai give it smooth. o, it offend me to the
soul, to hear a robusti periwig-pate fellow tear a passion to
tatter, to veri rag, to split the ear of the groundl, who,
for the most part, ar capabl of noth but inexplic dumb
show and nois: i would have such a fellow whip for o'erdo
termag; it out-herod herod: prai you avoid it.

i player.
i warrant your honour.

ham.
be not too tame neither; but let your own discret be your
tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
thi special observ, that you o'erstep not the modesti of
natur: for anyth so overdon is from the purpos of plai,
whose end, both at the first and now, wa and is, to hold, as
'twere, the mirror up to natur; to show virtu her own imag,
scorn her own imag, and the veri ag and bodi of the time hi
form and pressur. now, thi overdon, or come tardi off, though
it make the unskil laugh, cannot but make the judici
griev; the censur of the which on must in your allow,
o'erweigh a whole theatr of other. o, there be player that i
have seen plai,--and heard other prais, and that highli,--not
to speak it profan, that, neither have the accent of
christian, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strut and bellow that i have thought some of natur's
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, thei imit
human so abomin.

i player.
i hope we have reform'd that indiffer with us, sir.

ham.
o, reform it altogeth. and let those that plai your clown
speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
that will themselv laugh, to set on some quantiti of barren
spectat to laugh too, though in the meantim some necessari
question of the plai be then to be consid: that's villan
and show a most piti ambit in the fool that us it. go
make you readi.

[exeunt player.]

[enter poloniu, rosencrantz, and guildenstern.]

how now, my lord! will the king hear thi piec of work?

o, my dear lord,--

ham.
nai, do not think i flatter;
for what advanc mai i hope from thee,
that no revenu hast, but thy good spirit,
to feed and cloth thee? why should the poor be flatter'd?
no, let the candi tongu lick absurd pomp;
and crook the pregnant hing of the knee
where thrift mai follow fawn. dost thou hear?
sinc my dear soul wa mistress of her choic,
and could of men distinguish, her elect
hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
as on, in suffer all, that suffer noth;
a man that fortun's buffet and reward
hast ta'en with equal thank: and ble'd ar those
whose blood and judgment ar so well commingl
that thei ar not a pipe for fortun's finger
to sound what stop she pleas. give me that man
that is not passion's slave, and i will wear him
in my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
as i do thee.--someth too much of thi.--
there is a plai to-night befor the king;
on scene of it come near the circumst,
which i have told thee, of my father's death:
i pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
even with the veri comment of thy soul
observ mine uncl: if hi occult guilt
do not itself unkennel in on speech,
it is a damn ghost that we have seen;
and my imagin ar as foul
as vulcan's stithi. give him heed note;
for i mine ey will rivet to hi face;
and, after, we will both our judgment join
in censur of hi seem.

ham.
as woman's love.

[enter a king and a queen.]

p. king.
full thirti time hath phoebu' cart gone round
neptun's salt wash and tellu' orb ground,
and thirti dozen moon with borrow'd sheen
about the world have time twelv thirti been,
sinc love our heart, and hymen did our hand,
unit commutu in most sacr band.

p. queen.
so mani journei mai the sun and moon
make us again count o'er er love be done!
but, woe is me, you ar so sick of late,
so far from cheer and from your former state.
that i distrust you. yet, though i distrust,
discomfort you, my lord, it noth must:
for women's fear and love hold quantiti;
in neither aught, or in extrem.
now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
and as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
where love is great, the littlest doubt ar fear;
where littl fear grow great, great love grow there.

p. king.
faith, i must leav thee, love, and shortli too;
my oper power their function leav to do:
and thou shalt live in thi fair world behind,
honour'd, belov'd, and hapli on as kind
for husband shalt thou,--

p. queen.
o, confound the rest!
such love must need be treason in my breast:
in second husband let me be accurst!
none wed the second but who kill'd the first.

ham.
[asid.] wormwood, wormwood!

p. queen.
the instanc that second marriag move
ar base respect of thrift, but none of love.
a second time i kill my husband dead
when second husband kiss me in bed.

p. king.
i do believ you think what now you speak;
but what we do determin oft we break.
purpos is but the slave to memori;
of violent birth, but poor valid:
which now, like fruit unrip, stick on the tree;
but fall unshaken when thei mellow be.
most necessari 'ti that we forget
to pai ourselv what to ourselv is debt:
what to ourselv in passion we propos,
the passion end, doth the purpos lose.
the violenc of either grief or joi
their own enactur with themselv destroi:
where joi most revel, grief doth most lament;
grief joi, joi griev, on slender accid.
thi world is not for ay; nor 'ti not strang
that even our love should with our fortun chang;
for 'ti a question left us yet to prove,
whether love lead fortun, or els fortun love.
the great man down, you mark hi favourit fli,
the poor advanc'd make friend of enemi;
and hitherto doth love on fortun tend:
for who not need shall never lack a friend;
and who in want a hollow friend doth try,
directli season him hi enemi.
but, orderli to end where i begun,--
our will and fate do so contrari run
that our devic still ar overthrown;
our thought ar our, their end none of our own:
so think thou wilt no second husband wed;
but die thy thought when thy first lord is dead.

p. queen.
nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
sport and repos lock from me dai and night!

discours most eloqu music. look you, these ar the stop.

guil.
but these cannot i command to ani utter of harmoni; i
have not the skill.

ham.
why, look you now, how unworthi a thing you make of me! you
would plai upon me; you would seem to know my stop; you would
pluck out the heart of my mysteri; you would sound me from my
lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
excel voic, in thi littl organ, yet cannot you make it
speak. 'sblood, do you think i am easier to be plai on than a
pipe? call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
you cannot plai upon me.

[enter poloniu.]

god bless you, sir!

is there not rain enough in the sweet heaven
to wash it white as snow? whereto serv merci

and what's in prayer but thi twofold forc,--
to be forestal er we come to fall,
or pardon'd be down? then i'll look up;
my fault is past. but, o, what form of prayer
can serv my turn? forgiv me my foul murder!--
that cannot be; sinc i am still possess'd
of those effect for which i did the murder,--

leav wring of your hand: peac! sit you down,
and let me wring your heart: for so i shall,
if it be made of penetr stuff;
if damn custom have not braz'd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sens.

queen.
what have i done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongu
in nois so rude against me?

ham.
such an act
that blur the grace and blush of modesti;
call virtu hypocrit; take off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innoc love,
and set a blister there; make marriag-vow
as fals as dicer' oath: o, such a deed
as from the bodi of contract pluck
the veri soul, and sweet religion make
a rhapsodi of word: heaven's face doth glow;
yea, thi solid and compound mass,
with trist visag, as against the doom,
is thought-sick at the act.

queen.
ah me, what act,
that roar so loud, and thunder in the index?

ham.
look here upon thi pictur, and on thi,--
the counterfeit present of two brother.
see what a grace wa seat on thi brow;
hyperion's curl; the front of jove himself;
an ey like mar, to threaten and command;
a station like the herald mercuri
new light on a heaven-kiss hill:
a combin and a form, inde,
where everi god did seem to set hi seal,
to give the world assur of a man;
thi wa your husband.--look you now what follow:
here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
blast hi wholesom brother. have you ey?
could you on thi fair mountain leav to feed,
and batten on thi moor? ha! have you ey?
you cannot call it love; for at your ag
the hei-dai in the blood is tame, it's humbl,
and wait upon the judgment: and what judgment
would step from thi to thi? sens, sure, you have,
els could you not have motion: but sure that sens
is apoplex'd; for mad would not err;
nor sens to ecstaci wa ne'er so thrall'd
but it reserv'd some quantiti of choic
to serv in such a differ. what devil wa't
that thu hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
ey without feel, feel without sight,
ear without hand or ey, smell san all,
or but a sickli part of on true sens
could not so mope.
o shame! where is thy blush? rebelli hell,
if thou canst mutin in a matron's bone,
to flame youth let virtu be as wax,
and melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
when the compuls ardour give the charg,
sinc frost itself as activ doth burn,
and reason pander will.

queen.
o hamlet, speak no more:
thou turn'st mine ey into my veri soul;
and there i see such black and grain spot
as will not leav their tinct.

stew'd in corrupt, honei and make love
over the nasti sty,--

queen.
o, speak to me no more;
these word like dagger enter in mine ear;
no more, sweet hamlet.

ham.
a murder and a villain;
a slave that is not twentieth part the tith
of your preced lord; a vice of king;
a cutpurs of the empir and the rule,
that from a shelf the preciou diadem stole
and put it in hi pocket!

queen.
no more.

a king of shred and patch!--

[enter ghost.]

save me and hover o'er me with your wing,

but, look, amaz on thy mother sit:

speak to her, hamlet.

ham.
how is it with you, ladi?

queen.
ala, how is't with you,
that you do bend your ey on vacanc,
and with the incorpor air do hold discours?
forth at your ey your spirit wildli peep;
and, as the sleep soldier in the alarm,

start up and stand an end. o gentl son,
upon the heat and flame of thy distemp
sprinkl cool patienc! whereon do you look?

ham.
on him, on him! look you how pale he glare!
hi form and caus conjoin'd, preach to stone,
would make them capabl.--do not look upon me;
lest with thi piteou action you convert
my stern effect: then what i have to do
will want true colour; tear perchanc for blood.

thi is the veri coinag of your brain:
thi bodiless creation ecstasi

ecstasi!
my puls, as your, doth temper keep time,
and make as health music: it is not mad
that i have utter'd: bring me to the test,
and i the matter will re-word; which mad
would gambol from. mother, for love of grace,
lai not that flatter unction to your soul
that not your trespass, but my mad speak:
it will but skin and film the ulcer place,
whilst rank corrupt, mine all within,
infect unseen. confess yourself to heaven;
repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
and do not spread the compost on the weed,
to make them ranker. forgiv me thi my virtu;
for in the fat of these pursi time
virtu itself of vice must pardon beg,
yea, curb and woo for leav to do him good.

o, throw awai the worser part of it,
and live the purer with the other half.
good night: but go not to mine uncl's bed;
assum a virtu, if you have it not.
that monster custom, who all sens doth eat,
of habit evil, is angel yet in thi,--
that to the us of action fair and good
he likewis give a frock or liveri
that aptli is put on. refrain to-night;
and that shall lend a kind of easi

i must be cruel, onli to be kind:

not thi, by no mean, that i bid you do:
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
pinch wanton on your cheek; call you hi mous;
and let him, for a pair of reechi kiss,
or paddl in your neck with hi damn'd finger,
make you to ravel all thi matter out,
that i essenti am not in mad,
but mad in craft. 'twere good you let him know;
for who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
such dear concern hide? who would do so?
no, in despit of sens and secreci,
unpeg the basket on the hous's top,
let the bird fly, and, like the famou ap,
to try conclus, in the basket creep
and break your own neck down.

be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
sure he that made us with such larg discours,
look befor and after, gave us not
that capabl and godlik reason
to fust in us unu'd. now, whether it be
bestial oblivion, or some craven scrupl
of think too precis on the event,--
a thought which, quarter'd, hath but on part wisdom
and ever three part coward,--i do not know
why yet i live to sai 'thi thing's to do;'
sith i have caus, and will, and strength, and mean
to do't. exampl, gross as earth, exhort me:
wit thi armi, of such mass and charg,
led by a delic and tender princ;
whose spirit, with divin ambit puff'd,
make mouth at the invis event;
expos what is mortal and unsur
to all that fortun, death, and danger dare,
even for an egg-shell. rightli to be great
is not to stir without great argument,
but greatli to find quarrel in a straw
when honour's at the stake. how stand i, then,
that have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
excit of my reason and my blood,
and let all sleep? while, to my shame, i see
the immin death of twenti thousand men
that, for a fantasi and trick of fame,
go to their grave like bed; fight for a plot
whereon the number cannot try the caus,
which is not tomb enough and contin
to hide the slain?--o, from thi time forth,

it well appear:--but tell me
why you proceed not against these feat,
so crime and so capit in natur,
as by your safeti, wisdom, all thing els,

o, for two special reason;
which mai to you, perhap, seem much unsinew'd,
but yet to me thei ar strong. the queen hi mother
live almost by hi look; and for myself,--
my virtu or my plagu, be it either which,--
she's so conjunct to my life and soul,
that, as the star move not but in hi sphere,
i could not but by her. the other motiv,
why to a public count i might not go,
is the great love the gener gender bear him;
who, dip all hi fault in their affect,
would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
convert hi gyve to grace; so that my arrow,
too slightli timber'd for so loud a wind,
would have revert to my bow again,
and not where i had aim'd them.

and so have i a nobl father lost;
a sister driven into desper term,--
whose worth, if prais mai go back again,
stood challeng on mount of all the ag

break not your sleep for that:--you must not think
that we ar made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger,
and think it pastim. you shortli shall hear more:
i lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
and that, i hope, will teach you to imagin,--

'ti hamlet's charact:--'nake!'--
and in a postscript here, he sai 'alon.'
can you advis me?

laer.
i am lost in it, my lord. but let him come;
it warm the veri sick in my heart
that i shall live and tell him to hi teeth,
'thu didest thou.'

if it be so, laert,--
as how should it be so? how otherwis?--
will you be rul'd by me?

laer.
ay, my lord;
so you will not o'errul me to a peac.

king.
to thine own peac. if he be now return'd--
as check at hi voyag, and that he mean
no more to undertak it,--i will work him
to exploit, now ripe in my devic,
under the which he shall not choos but fall:
and for hi death no wind shall breath;
but even hi mother shall uncharg the practic
and call it accid.

laer.
my lord, i will be rul'd;
the rather if you could devis it so
that i might be the organ.

king.
it fall right.
you have been talk'd of sinc your travel much,
and that in hamlet's hear, for a qualiti
wherein thei sai you shine: your sum of part
did not togeth pluck such envi from him
as did that on; and that, in my regard,
of the unworthiest sieg.

laer.
what part is that, my lord?

king.
a veri riband in the cap of youth,
yet need too; for youth no less becom
the light and careless liveri that it wear
than settl ag hi sabl and hi weed,
import health and grave.--two month sinc,
here wa a gentleman of normandi,--
i've seen myself, and serv'd against, the french,
and thei can well on horseback: but thi gallant
had witchcraft in't: he grew unto hi seat;
and to such wondrou do brought hi hors,
as had he been incorp'd and demi-natur'd
with the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
that i, in forgeri of shape and trick,
come short of what he did.

laer.
a norman wa't?

king.
a norman.

laer.
upon my life, lamond.

king.
the veri same.

laer.
i know him well: he is the brooch inde
and gem of all the nation.

king.
he made confess of you;
and gave you such a masterli report
for art and exercis in your defenc,
and for your rapier most especi,
that he cri out, 'twould be a sight inde
if on could match you: the scrimer of their nation
he swore, had neither motion, guard, nor ey,
if you oppo'd them. sir, thi report of hi
did hamlet so envenom with hi envi
that he could noth do but wish and beg
your sudden come o'er, to plai with him.
now, out of thi,--

laer.
what out of thi, my lord?

king.
laert, wa your father dear to you?
or ar you like the paint of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

laer.
why ask you thi?

king.
not that i think you did not love your father;
but that i know love is begun by time,
and that i see, in passag of proof,
time qualifi the spark and fire of it.
there live within the veri flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abat it;
and noth is at a like good still;
for good, grow to a plurisi,
di in hi own too much: that we would do,
we should do when we would; for thi 'would' chang,
and hath abat and delai as mani
as there ar tongu, ar hand, ar accid;
and then thi 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
that hurt by eas. but to the quick o' the ulcer:--
hamlet come back: what would you undertak
to show yourself your father's son in deed
more than in word?

laer.
to cut hi throat i' the church.

king.
no place, inde, should murder sanctuar;
reveng should have no bound. but, good laert,
will you do thi, keep close within your chamber.
hamlet return'd shall know you ar come home:
we'll put on those shall prais your excel
and set a doubl varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you; bring you in fine togeth
and wager on your head: he, be remiss,
most gener, and free from all contriv,
will not perus the foil; so that with eas,
or with a littl shuffl, you mai choos
a sword unbat, and, in a pass of practic,
requit him for your father.

laer.
i will do't:
and for that purpos i'll anoint my sword.
i bought an unction of a mountebank,
so mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
where it draw blood no cataplasm so rare,
collect from all simpl that have virtu
under the moon, can save the thing from death
thi is but scratch'd withal: i'll touch my point
with thi contagion, that, if i gall him slightli,
it mai be death.

king.
let's further think of thi;
weigh what conveni both of time and mean
mai fit us to our shape: if thi should fail,
and that our drift look through our bad perform.
'twere better not assai'd: therefor thi project
should have a back or second, that might hold
if thi did blast in proof. soft! let me see:--
we'll make a solemn wager on your cun,--
i ha't:
when in your motion you ar hot and dry,--
as make your bout more violent to that end,--

so fast thei follow:--your sister's drown'd, laert.

laer.
drown'd! o, where?

queen.
there is a willow grow aslant a brook,
that show hi hoar leav in the glassi stream;
there with fantast garland did she come
of crowflow, nettl, daisi, and long purpl,
that liber shepherd give a grosser name,
but our cold maid do dead men's finger call them.
there, on the pendant bough her coronet weed
clamb'ring to hang, an enviou sliver broke;
when down her weedi trophi and herself
fell in the weep brook. her cloth spread wide;
and, mermaid-like, awhil thei bore her up;
which time she chaunt snatch of old tune;
as on incap of her own distress,
or like a creatur nativ and indu'd
unto that element: but long it could not be
till that her garment, heavi with their drink,
pull'd the poor wretch from her melodi lai
to muddi death.

laer.
ala, then she is drown'd?

queen.
drown'd, drown'd.

laer.
too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia,
and therefor i forbid my tear: but yet
it is our trick; natur her custom hold,
let shame sai what it will: when these ar gone,
the woman will be out.--adieu, my lord:
i have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
but that thi folli dout it.

[exit.]

1 clown.
how can that be, unless she drown herself in her own defenc?

2 clown.

1 clown.
it must be se offendendo; it cannot be els. for here li

2 clown.
but is thi law?

1 clown.
ay, marri, is't--crowner's quest law.

2 clown.

gentlewoman, she should have been buri out o' christian burial.

1 clown.
why, there thou sai'st: and the more piti that great folk
should have counten in thi world to drown or hang themselv
more than their even christian.--come, my spade. there is no

2 clown.

question next, sai 'a grave-maker;' the hous he make last
till doomsdai. go, get thee to yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
liquor.

[exit second clown.]

[dig and sing.]

   in youth when i did love, did love,

ham.

hor.
custom hath made it in him a properti of easi.

   but ag, with hi steal step,

   and hath shipp'd me into the land,

[throw up a skull.]

ham.
that skull had a tongu in it, and could sing onc: how the
knave jowl it to the ground,as if 'twere cain's jawbon, that
did the first murder! thi might be the pate of a politician,
which thi ass now o'erreach; on that would circumv god,
might it not?

or of a courtier, which could sai 'good morrow, sweet lord!

where be hi quiddit now, hi quillet, hi case, hi tenur,
and hi trick? why doe he suffer thi rude knave now to knock
him about the sconc with a dirti shovel, and will not tell him
of hi action of batteri? hum! thi fellow might be in's time a
great buyer of land, with hi statut, hi recogniz, hi
fine, hi doubl voucher, hi recoveri: is thi the fine of
hi fine, and the recoveri of hi recoveri, to have hi fine
pate full of fine dirt? will hi voucher vouch him no more of
hi purchas, and doubl on too, than the length and breadth
of a pair of indentur? the veri convey of hi land will
scarc lie in thi box; and must the inheritor himself have no
more, ha?

hor.

1 clown.
on that wa a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

ham.
how absolut the knave is! we must speak by the card, or
equivoc will undo us. by the lord, horatio, these three
year i have taken note of it, the ag is grown so pick that
the toe of the peasant come so near the heel of the courtier he

1 clown.
of all the dai i' the year, i came to't that dai that our
last king hamlet overcam fortinbra.

ham.
how long is that sinc?

1 clown.
cannot you tell that? everi fool can tell that: it wa the

ham.
ay, marri, why wa be sent into england?

1 clown.
why, becaus he wa mad: he shall recov hi wit there;
or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

1 clown.
faith, if he be not rotten befor he die,--as we have mani
pocki cors now-a-dai that will scarc hold the lai in,--he
will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
you nine year.

ham.
why he more than anoth?

1 clown.
why, sir, hi hide is so tann'd with hi trade that he will
keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decay of
your whoreson dead bodi. here's a skull now; thi skull hath lain
in the earth three-and-twenti year.

ham.
to what base us we mai return, horatio! why mai not
imagin trace the nobl dust of alexand till he find it
stop a bung-hole?

hor.
'twere to consid too curious to consid so.

ham.
no, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesti
enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thu: alexand di,
alexand wa buri, alexand returneth into dust; the dust is
earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
wa convert might thei not stop a beer-barrel?
   imperi caesar, dead and turn'd to clai,
   might stop a hole to keep the wind awai.
   o, that that earth which kept the world in aw
   should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
but soft! but soft! asid!--here come the king.

[enter priest, &c, in process; the corps of ophelia,

her obsequi have been as far enlarg'd
as we have warranti: her death wa doubt;
and, but that great command o'erswai the order,
she should in ground unsanctifi have lodg'd
till the last trumpet; for charit prayer,
shard, flint, and pebbl should be thrown on her,
yet here she is allow her virgin rite,
her maiden strewment, and the bring home
of bell and burial.

laer.
must there no more be done?

1 priest.

laer.

and from her fair and unpollut flesh
mai violet spring!--i tell thee, churlish priest,
a minist angel shall my sister be

ham.
what, the fair ophelia?

queen.
sweet to the sweet: farewel.
[scatter flower.]
i hop'd thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife;
i thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
and not have strew'd thy grave.

laer.
o, trebl woe
fall ten time trebl on that curs head
whose wick deed thy most ingeni sens
depriv'd thee of!--hold off the earth awhil,

[leap into the grave.]
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
till of thi flat a mountain you have made,
to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head
of blue olympu.

ham.
[advanc.]

[the attend part them, and thei come out of the grave.]

ham.
why, i will fight with him upon thi theme
until my eyelid will no longer wag.

queen.
o my son, what theme?

ham.
i lov'd ophelia; forti thousand brother
could not, with all their quantiti of love,
make up my sum.--what wilt thou do for her?

king.
o, he is mad, laert.

queen.
for love of god, forbear him!

ham.
'swound, show me what thou'lt do:
woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodil?
i'll do't.--dost thou come here to whine?
to outfac me with leap in her grave?
be buri quick with her, and so will i:
and, if thou prate of mountain, let them throw
million of acr on us, till our ground,
sing hi pate against the burn zone,
make ossa like a wart! nai, an thou'lt mouth,
i'll rant as well as thou.

queen.
thi is mere mad:
and thu a while the fit will work on him;
anon, as patient as the femal dove,
when that her golden couplet ar disclo'd,
hi silenc will sit droop.

ham.

what is the reason that you us me thu?
i lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;

scene ii. a hall in the castl.

[enter hamlet and horatio.]

ham.
so much for thi, sir: now let me see the other;
you do rememb all the circumst?

hor.
rememb it, my lord!

ham.
sir, in my heart there wa a kind of fight
that would not let me sleep: methought i lai
wors than the mutini in the bilbo. rashli,
and prai'd be rash for it,--let us know,
our indiscret sometim serv us well,
when our deep plot do fail; and that should teach us
there's a divin that shape our end,
rough-hew them how we will.

hor.
that is most certain.

ham.
up from my cabin,
my sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
grop'd i to find out them: had my desir;
finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
to mine own room again: make so bold,
my fear forget manner, to unseal
their grand commiss; where i found, horatio,
o royal knaveri! an exact command,--
lard with mani sever sort of reason,
import denmark's health, and england's too,
with, ho! such bug and goblin in my life,--
that, on the supervis, no leisur bate,
no, not to stai the grind of the ax,
my head should be struck off.

hor.
is't possibl?

ham.
here's the commiss: read it at more leisur.
but wilt thou bear me how i did proce?

hor.
i beseech you.

ham.
be thu benet round with villani,--
or i could make a prologu to my brain,
thei had begun the plai,--i sat me down;
devi'd a new commiss; wrote it fair:
i onc did hold it, as our statist do,
a base to write fair, and labour'd much
how to forget that learn; but, sir, now
it did me yeoman's servic. wilt thou know
the effect of what i wrote?

hor.
ay, good my lord.

ham.
an earnest conjur from the king,--
as england wa hi faith tributari;
as love between them like the palm might flourish;
as peac should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma 'tween their amiti;
and mani such-like as's of great charg,--
that, on the view and know of these content,
without debat further, more or less,
he should the bearer put to sudden death,
not shrive-time allow'd.

hor.
how wa thi seal'd?

ham.
why, even in that wa heaven ordin.
i had my father's signet in my purs,
which wa the model of that danish seal:
fold the writ up in the form of the other;
subscrib'd it: gave't the impress; plac'd it safe,
the changel never known. now, the next dai
wa our sea-fight; and what to thi wa sequent
thou know'st alreadi.

hor.
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't.

ham.
why, man, thei did make love to thi employ;
thei ar not near my conscienc; their defeat
doe by their own insinu grow:
'ti danger when the baser natur come
between the pass and fell incens point
of mighti opposit.

hor.
why, what a king is thi!

ham.
doe it not, think't thee, stand me now upon,--
he that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
popp'd in between the elect and my hope;
thrown out hi angl for my proper life,
and with such cozenag--is't not perfect conscienc
to quit him with thi arm? and is't not to be damn'd
to let thi canker of our natur come
in further evil?

hor.
it must be shortli known to him from england
what is the issu of the busi there.

ham.
it will be short: the interim is mine;
and a man's life is no more than to sai on.
but i am veri sorri, good horatio,
that to laert i forgot myself;
for by the imag of my caus i see
the portraitur of hi: i'll court hi favour:
but, sure, the braveri of hi grief did put me
into a tower passion.

hor.
peac; who come here?

[enter osric.]

osr.
your lordship is right welcom back to denmark.

ham.
i humbl thank you, sir. dost know thi water-fly?

hor.
no, my good lord.

ham.
thy state is the more graciou; for 'ti a vice to know him. he
hath much land, and fertil: let a beast be lord of beast, and
hi crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'ti a chough; but, as i
sai, spaciou in the possess of dirt.

osr.
sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisur, i should
impart a thing to you from hi majesti.

ham.
i will receiv it with all dilig of spirit. put your
bonnet to hi right us; 'ti for the head.

osr.
i thank your lordship, t'is veri hot.

ham.

osr.
it is indiffer cold, my lord, inde.

ham.
methink it is veri sultri and hot for my complexion.

osr.
exceedingli, my lord; it is veri sultri,--as 'twere--i cannot
tell how. but, my lord, hi majesti bade me signifi to you that
he ha laid a great wager on your head. sir, thi is the
matter,--

ham.
i beseech you, rememb,--
[hamlet move him to put on hi hat.]

osr.
nai, in good faith; for mine eas, in good faith. sir, here
is newli come to court laert; believ me, an absolut
gentleman, full of most excel differ, of veri soft
societi and great show: inde, to speak feelingli of him, he
is the card or calendar of gentri; for you shall find in him the
contin of what part a gentleman would see.

ham.
sir, hi defin suffer no perdit in you;--though, i
know, to divid him inventori would dizzi the arithmet of
memori, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of hi quick sail.
but, in the veriti of extol, i take him to be a soul of great
articl, and hi infus of such dearth and rare as, to make
true diction of him, hi semblabl is hi mirror, and who els
would trace him, hi umbrag, noth more.

osr.
your lordship speak most infal of him.

ham.
the concern, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath?

osr.
sir?

hor.
is't not possibl to understand in anoth tongu? you will do't,
sir, realli.

ham.
what import the nomin of thi gentleman?

osr.

hi purs is empti alreadi; all's golden word ar spent.

ham.

osr.
i know, you ar not ignor,--

ham.
i would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
much approv me.--well, sir.

osr.
you ar not ignor of what excel laert is,--

ham.
i dare not confess that, lest i should compar with him in
excel; but to know a man well were to know himself.

osr.
i mean, sir, for hi weapon; but in the imput laid on
him by them, in hi meed he's unfellow.

ham.
what's hi weapon?

osr.
rapier and dagger.

ham.
that's two of hi weapon:--but well.

osr.
the king, sir, hath wager'd with him six barbari hors:
against the which he ha impon, as i take it, six french
rapier and poniard, with their assign, as girdl, hanger, and
so: three of the carriag, in faith, ar veri dear to fanci,
veri respons to the hilt, most delic carriag, and of
veri liber conceit.

ham.
what call you the carriag?

hor.
i knew you must be edifi by the margent er you had done.

osr.
the carriag, sir, ar the hanger.

ham.
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
carri cannon by our side. i would it might be hanger till then.
but, on: six barbari hors against six french sword, their
assign, and three liber conceit carriag: that's the french
bet against the danish: why is thi all impon, as you call it?

osr.
the king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen pass between
your and him, he shall not exce you three hit: he hath
laid on twelv for nine; and it would come to immedi trial
if your lordship would vouchsaf the answer.

ham.
how if i answer no?

osr.
i mean, my lord, the opposit of your person in trial.

ham.
sir, i will walk here in the hall: if it pleas hi majesti,
it is the breath time of dai with me: let the foil be
brought, the gentleman will, and the king hold hi purpos,
i will win for him if i can; if not, i will gain noth but my
shame and the odd hit.

osr.
shall i re-deliv you e'en so?

ham.
to thi effect, sir; after what flourish your natur will.

osr.

not a whit, we defi auguri: there's a special provid in
the fall of a sparrow. if it be now, 'ti not to come; if it be
not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
the readi is all: sinc no man ha aught of what he leav,
what is't to leav betim?

[enter king, queen, laert, lord, osric, and attend with
foil &c.]

king.
come, hamlet, come, and take thi hand from me.

[the king put laert' hand into hamlet's.]

ham.
give me your pardon, sir: i have done you wrong:
but pardon't, as you ar a gentleman.
thi presenc know, and you must need have heard,
how i am punish'd with sore distract.
what i have done
that might your natur, honour, and except
roughli awak, i here proclaim wa mad.
wa't hamlet wrong'd laert? never hamlet:
if hamlet from himself be ta'en awai,
and when he's not himself doe wrong laert,
then hamlet doe it not, hamlet deni it.
who doe it, then? hi mad: if't be so,
hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
hi mad is poor hamlet's enemi.
sir, in thi audienc,
let my disclaim from a purpo'd evil
free me so far in your most gener thought
that i have shot my arrow o'er the hous
and hurt my brother.

laer.
i am satisfi in natur,
whose motiv, in thi case, should stir me most
to my reveng. but in my term of honour
i stand aloof; and will no reconcil
till by some elder master of known honour
i have a voic and preced of peac
to keep my name ungor'd. but till that time
i do receiv your offer'd love like love,
and will not wrong it.

ham.
i embrac it freeli;
and will thi brother's wager frankli plai.--
give us the foil; come on.

laer.
come, on for me.

ham.
i'll be your foil, laert; in mine ignor
your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
stick fieri off inde.

laer.
you mock me, sir.

ham.
no, by thi hand.

king.
give them the foil, young osric. cousin hamlet,
you know the wager?

ham.
veri well, my lord;
your grace ha laid the odd o' the weaker side.

king.
i do not fear it; i have seen you both;
but sinc he's better'd, we have therefor odd.

laer.
thi is too heavi, let me see anoth.

ham.
thi like me well. these foil have all a length?

[thei prepar to plai.]

osr.
ay, my good lord.

king.
set me the stoup of wine upon that tabl,--
if hamlet give the first or second hit,
or quit in answer of the third exchang,
let all the battlement their ordnanc fire;
the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath;
and in the cup an union shall he throw,
richer than that which four success king
in denmark's crown have worn. give me the cup;
and let the kettl to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannon without,
the cannon to the heaven, the heaven to earth,
'now the king drink to hamlet.'--come, begin:--
and you, the judg, bear a wari ey.

ham.
come on, sir.

laer.
come, my lord.

[thei plai.]

ham.
on.

laer.
no.

ham.
judgment!

osr.
a hit, a veri palpabl hit.

laer.
well;--again.

king.
stai, give me drink.--hamlet, thi pearl is thine;
here's to thy health.--

[trumpet sound, and cannon shot off within.]

give him the cup.

ham.
i'll plai thi bout first; set it by awhil.--
come.--anoth hit; what sai you?

[thei plai.]

laer.
a touch, a touch, i do confess.

king.
our son shall win.

queen.
he's fat, and scant of breath.--
here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brow:
the queen carous to thy fortun, hamlet.

ham.
good madam!

king.
gertrud, do not drink.

queen.
i will, my lord; i prai you pardon me.

king.
[asid.] it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.

ham.
i dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.

queen.
come, let me wipe thy face.

laer.
my lord, i'll hit him now.

king.
i do not think't.

laer.
[asid.] and yet 'ti almost 'gainst my conscienc.

ham.
come, for the third, laert: you but dalli;
i prai you pass with your best violenc:
i am afeard you make a wanton of me.

laer.
sai you so? come on.

[thei plai.]

osr.
noth, neither wai.

laer.

[laert wound hamlet; then, in scuffl, thei
chang rapier, and hamlet wound laert.]

king.
part them; thei ar incen'd.

ham.
nai, come again!

[the queen fall.]

osr.
look to the queen there, ho!

hor.
thei bleed on both side.--how is it, my lord?

osr.
how is't, laert?

laer.
why, as a woodcock to my own spring, osric;
i am justli kill'd with mine own treacheri.

ham.
how doe the queen?

king.
